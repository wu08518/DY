            title: 'Can you explain the structure and why you’ve chosen it?',
            description: ' We have chosen the straddle the line between traditional VC and Crypto funds and the new tokenized VC model that has recently seen traction. In the traditional VC model, there are 3 phases:              1.Marketing: The General Partners seek to raise funding for the project by seeking out Limited Partners that provide capital.              2.Commitment: After funding has closed (additional funding rounds may occur), the GP starts to put the capital to work, calling in the actual investment as it is deployed. Capital investments are made throughout this period at the discretion of the GP.              3.Divestment: The GP terminates new investments and seeks to liquidate holdings at favorable times. All liquidations are returned to the Partners in the fund over the term of the divestment period.              The major downside to this time tested method is that the total time period ranges from 7-15 years of investment lock-up. Any early withdrawals that occur come at a heavy discount.           The new tokenized VC model essentially operates as a closed end investment fund that issues tokens rather than shares. The capital is raised, tokens are issued and then no more investment goes in or out of the fund. Tokens are not redeemable for assets from the fund manager. Rather, these tokens can be traded, typically at some price close to the fund’s NAV providing liquidity but also exposure to VC like investments. We are intrigued by this new model and will consider it for future funds.         Realbit.Capital’s structure sits in the middle of these approaches in what we consider an attractive hybrid. We will still use a Marketing, Commitment and Divestment methodology but with much shorter lock-up periods. Due to the nature of the ICO market, these assets become liquid much sooner than traditional tech equity IPOs. Due to KYC/AML considerations, we will also know all of our investors and can more easily distribute investment gains through various methods in the divestment period because our investors have not changed. Finally, we may make divestments to investors in the assets held by the fund which may have beneficial tax implications over a purely bitcoin distribution (this is not tax or legal advice!).'

          {
            title: 'How will investors be paid dividends, capital appreciation?',
            description: ' As with the model described above, all the funds remaining capital will be disbursed to our investors during the divestment period. We will wind down the fund in an orderly fashion so as not to cause any negative price pressure on our investments. The funds will then be dispersed as BTC or ETH to our investors on a pro rata basis. We are considering also allowing the option of have disbursements being made in the underlying assets, assuming they are liquid and easily exchange traded.'

There are small differences in fees, detailed in our offering documents.            Realbit ICO Fund – Focus on ICO investments results in this fund having a higher risk/return profile. Investments will be made in ICO pre-sales, private sales, public sales and in recently exchanged traded tokens. As is typical in VC investing, many of our investments will yield little or no return, however those losses will be covered by the few investments that have extraordinary returns.            Realbit Crypto 150 – Limited to investing in the top 150 largest cryptocurrency projects by market capitalization. Since the entire crypto-asset space is so new, our lock in period is short as we aim to select for the assets that have the highest near term over performance potential.'

Therefore, our soft-cap is relatively low, we just to have enough invested assets to cover our operational costs. We have included a hard-cap even though all additional investment will be put into the fund so that we can keep our fund size manageable. Especially for the ICO fund, too much capital may be a bad thing.'

            title: 'How do you choose investments?',
            description: 'In essence, VC models are most applicable here and we will scrutinize people, product, technology, market and competition. In addition, we also must understand the token economics built into each company’s offering. A key consideration is valuation. In mid-2018, many ICOs seem to be overpriced (while the more mature Crypto 150 has the potential to find many undervalued assets). Too many institutions chasing a subset of investments seems to have led to excessive valuation levels at the pre-sale/private sale level. As a result, some ICOs have had price collapses when they are listed on exchanges despite gold star investors. The ICO fund’s mandate is to invest in the highest growth, highest risk ICO projects and at times that will include recently listed ICOs. '

Even if we feel very strongly about a particular opportunity, we won’t invest 50% of the portfolio because of the extreme levels of risk each asset represents. No ICO will represent more than 5% of our portfolio (at time of purchase) and no sector will compromise more than 20% of each portfolio. We benefit from diversification but still have the ability to make smart, high return choices.'

            title: 'What risks are involved?',
            description: ' Crypto-assets in general are already considered a very high risk asset class. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose in any crypto-asset, fund, ICO or any investment for that matter. We recommend that prudent investors can allocate up to 10% of their investable assets in crypto-assets. A recent study by J Liew at Johns Hopkins University suggested a 1.3% allocation to bitcoin for institutional investors. Individuals may adjust their allocation based on age, income and many other factors. Please consult your financial advisors before making major investment decisions.            You can find a more comprehensive list and description of risks in our prospectus.'

Most or substantially all of our assets may not be traded on an exchange at any given time during the commitment period, or may trade but in volumes so small as to be uninformative. In general, the Investment Committee of the funds will be able to value the price of an individual crypto-asset at one of these three general levels:1.Price of the crypto-asset being traded on an exchange in sufficient volume. Sufficient volume is determined to be a level of volume that could sustain the sale by the Fund of a significant minority of its position without a materially influencing the price; 2.The purchase price of the asset by the Fund; 3.Zero if the Investment Committee determines the project is a scam, fraud, dead or mostly dead'

If you are unable to lock-up your money for the funds’ required time period, perhaps you should evaluate other, more liquid, opportunities. However, if there are redemption requests, and our portfolio liquidity permits us to meet them, we may make discretionary decisions if there is not impact on other investors.
